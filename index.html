  <p>
    Hello, my name is KC Hofstetter and I live in Seattle, WA. I am 27 years old and have lived in Seattle since 2017 when I graduated from college. I attended Eastern Washington University to pursue my Bachelors of Science degree in Dental Hygiene. Ever since I have been working as a hygienist in different offices around Seattle. All this time I never felt passionate about the dental field, and found that I didn't feel connected to this career enough to sign on full-time with any office. Although I feel very competent as a dental hygienist, my goal is to find a career that challenges me and opens more doors. My goal is to pursue a career in software development! The entire tech field is incredibly fascinating and very expansive. I'm excited to see which path I ultimately decide to move towards!
